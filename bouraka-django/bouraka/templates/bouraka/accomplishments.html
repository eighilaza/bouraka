                    <p class="lead" align="justify">Between 1995 and 1996, the new rules of the competition require the team to design a new prototype. Thanks to technological advances, the team develops "ORCA" by using mainly of carbon fiber. In addition, work on aerodynamics makes his appearance change dramatically from the previous prototype. A new engine is also designed to reduce consumption.Thus, ORCA is lighter, and therefore more efficient than its predecessor, and in 2000 he established his own record with a performance of 990 km/L on the Nogaro circuit, in France.</p>

                    <p class="lead" align="justify">In 2004, the team seizes a great opportunity. Taking advantage of an offer from Eurocopter, the PIC was able to acquire one of the seven hulls prototype (named « TED ») that the company built to present them at the Shell Eco Marathon. The work to be done to transform a single-hull into an eligible to compete vehicle is huge. But this year, the team reached a membership of 40 members for the first time, and motivation is at its peak.
                    Lots of points had been called into question, as the engine, the chassis, the onboard electronic and the calculator…that is to say that the team was left virtually to zero. After 8 moths of hard work, the PIC decided to run the Educ’Eco at Nogaro (France). With a new car and virtually untested, the team managed to achieve a surprising result for the first round of EPIC, with a performance of 1348 km/ L, placing it to the 17th place in the overall standings ! What is more, the team wrote a record of the behavior of ball bearings depending on the preload and the type of lubrication. This file was awarded the first prize of National Education ! This folder will be followed in 2005-2006 by a battery of tests carried out in partnership with a laboratory of the INSA Lyon.</p>

                    <p class="lead" align="justify">The performance of the prototype in the previous season showed his potential. The objectives were therefore to improve reliability and to avoid the problems encountered, as engine sensors deficient, some electronic problems, a big problem with chain (multiple derailments), and even problems with compressed air. For the second participation of EPIC at the Shell Eco Marathon, reliability goals to earn places in the rankings were made ! The prototype validated the four runs allowed, and improved performance each time to reach 1829 km/ L ! The last run has earned us a 10th position on 258 participants overall, a 5th place in gasoline, and an 8th place in the student ranking. Alongside the competition, that year the PIC presented two folders : one on a simulator for the Technical Innovation Award, and one for the price of Communications. These awards are designed to highlight something other than the performance of the prototype, and the simulator was one of the great surprises and attractions during the race. It allows anyone to take the position of the EPIC pilot and run virtually laps in Nogaro. It has received the Special Mention of the Jury Technical Innovation. However, the team still had work regarding communication…</p>
